# Introduction to Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with PyTorch Geometric

This repository is designed to introduce beginners to the world of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). It offers a series of tutorials that cover various techniques in the field of Geometric Machine Learning. Whether you're a student, developer, or researcher, this resource will help you understand how GNNs work and how to implement them using the PyTorch Geometric library.

## Getting Started

To run these tutorials, you'll need the following dependencies:
- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/): Install PyTorch for deep learning capabilities.
- [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/): Use Anaconda for managing Python environments.
- [PyTorch Geometric (PyG)](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/): Follow the installation instructions provided in the PyG documentation.
