# Getting Started with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) Using PyTorch Geometric

Welcome to the world of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)! This repository is designed to introduce beginners to GNNs and provide a series of tutorials on various techniques in Geometric Machine Learning. Whether you're a student, developer, or researcher, this resource will help you understand how GNNs work and how to implement them using the PyTorch Geometric library.

## Getting Started

To run these tutorials, you'll need the following dependencies:

- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/): Install PyTorch for deep learning capabilities.
- [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/): Use Anaconda for managing Python environments.
- [PyTorch Geometric (PyG)](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/): Follow the installation instructions provided in the PyG documentation.
- [NetworkX](https://networkx.github.io/): Install NetworkX for graph-related operations.

## Tutorials

This repository offers a series of tutorials to help you grasp the concepts of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and how to apply them using PyTorch Geometric:

1. [NetworkX Graph Tutorial](NetworkX_Graph_Tutorial.ipynb): Learn about NetworkX and its applications in graph-related operations.

2. [Node Embedding Pipeline](Node_Embedding_Pipeline.ipynb): Explore a comprehensive pipeline for node embedding in graph data.
