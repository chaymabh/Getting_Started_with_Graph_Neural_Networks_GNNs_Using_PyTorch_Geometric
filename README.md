# GNN for Beginners

This repository serves as an introduction to Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and provides a series of tutorials covering various techniques in the field of Geometric Machine Learning. The tutorials focus on explaining how GNNs work and how to implement them using the PyTorch Geometric library, which is an extension to PyTorch.

## Installation

To run the tutorials, you need to install the following dependencies:

1. [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) - Install PyTorch for deep learning capabilities.
2. [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) - Install Anaconda for managing Python environments.
3. [PyTorch Geometric (PyG)](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notes/installation.html) - Follow the installation instructions provided in the PyG documentation.
4. [NetworkX](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/install.html) - Install NetworkX for graph-related operations.
